what the plan is.

have a webpage that has a little area to insert a tweet that will post to the 
twitter bot app and store what was posted in the database.

make the app check the database for a new 'thought' from the database.
if there is a NEW 'thought' post it. 
if not just don't do anything.



what i need:
    a mongoose database. DONE
    pull from mongoose/send dynamic data into twitter update. DONE
    setup some sort of job to hit endpoint everyday at 12:15pm DONE  
    a frontend for people to submit data. DONE

    add logging
    authentication to submit ideas?
